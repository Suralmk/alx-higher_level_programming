##  Python programming language

Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Pythonâ€™s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platform

# The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters
<ul>

<li>Beautiful is better than ugly.</li>
<li>Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
<li>Simple is better than complex.</li>
<li>Complex is better than complicated.</li>
<li>Flat is better than nested.</li>
<li>Sparse is better than dense.</li>
<li>Readability counts.</li>
<li>Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.</li>
<li>Although practicality beats purity.</li>
<li>Errors should never pass silently.</li>
<li>Unless explicitly silenced.</li>
<li>In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.</li>
<li>There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.</li>
<li>Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.</li>
<li>Now is better than never.</li>
<li>Although never is often better than *right* now.</li>
<li>If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.</li>
<li>If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.</li>
<li>Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!</li>
</ul>
